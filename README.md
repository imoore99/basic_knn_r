## Back to Basics: KNN with R

#### K-Nearest Neighbors Implementation & Optimization

##### PROJECT OVERVIEW:
- Purpose: Demonstrate K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm from fundamentals to practical implementation, building KNN from scratch and using professional R tools for credit utilization prediction.
- Objective: Predict customer credit card utilization rates using income and education features, comparing manual KNN implementation with regtools package while optimizing hyperparameters through systematic testing.

##### DATA SOURCES:

Dataset: ISLR Credit dataset (400 individuals)
Features: Income, Education, Credit Limit, Demographics
Target: Credit card utilization rate (Balance/Limit * 100)
Prediction Example: $100K income earner with 14 years education

##### TECHNOLOGIES USED:
Core Stack:

- R - Primary programming environment
- ISLR - Credit dataset for analysis
- regtools - Professional KNN implementation with validation
- qeML - Quick machine learning functions

Implementation Approaches:

Manual KNN - Built from scratch using distance calculations and averaging
regtools KNN - Production-ready implementation with automatic validation
MAPE Optimization - Custom loss function for hyperparameter tuning

Development Tools:

Jupyter Notebook - R kernel for interactive analysis
RStudio - Alternative IDE support
